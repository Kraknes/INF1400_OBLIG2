To use pygame it first must be installed with the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```bash
pip install foobar
```

After installation pygame is imported in the boids.py file. 

```python
import pygame. 
```
## Random

Python library random is used to create randomized values to speed and location of static and movable objects in the boids.py file. No installation required. 

```python
import random. 
```

## Math

Python library math is used to solve more mathematical equations regarding speed to movable objects in the boids.py file. No installation required. 

```python
import math. 
```
